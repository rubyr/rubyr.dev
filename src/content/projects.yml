    TMATE2 is a webapp that aims to preserve the legacy of
    [The Most Awesomest Thing Ever](http://www.mostawesomestthingever.com/),
    which unfortunately, uses Adobe Flash, and as such doesn't currently work.
    This app was made over the span of four days, and uses the entirety of the
    English Wikipedia, so some comparisons that come up may be asinine or
    obscure. This is intentional.

    Yes, this very site has a section about itself. because i'm quite proud of
    how it's made! under the hood, it uses Svelte + typescript, and the styles
    are written in SASS.
